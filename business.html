		<h1>Mountain Beach House Studio</h1>
		<p>I have been running a recording studio business for the past six years. After graduating from BYU in Music and Sound Recording Technology, I rented an office space in Downtown Provo and produced albums and records for many local artists. I have since moved to Los Angeles, Indiana, and now Utah, and all that time have operated my studio out of my home.</p>
		<p>In addition to writing and recording my own music, I have also produced and recorded albums for Grizzly Goat, Likelihood, Taylor Carraway, Jaren McMillan (now of Vocal Point), and Heather McGregor, among others.</p>
